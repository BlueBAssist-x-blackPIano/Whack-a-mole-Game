# Whack-a-mole

I have a made an interactive arcade type Whack-a-mole game which features a 'mole' poppig randomly on a 3*3 grid and challenges the user to click on it before it disappears within 0.5 to 1.5 seconds.
<br>
It contains a responsive design and features such as Start/Reset, 60-second timer and Score tracker.

This project was built using React to demonstrate the use of hooks (useState, useEffect, useRef) for state management and component lifecycle handling in a fun, interactive application.
